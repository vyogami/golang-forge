## Getting Started

To use Golang Forge, you will need to have go installed on your machine. You can download go from the official website: <https://go.dev/dl/>.

### Requirements

- Golang Forge does not have any additional requirements beyond go itself.
- Any required third-party libraries or modules specified in the individual files

### Usage

You can use Golang Forge by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legitShivam/golang-forge.git
```

From there, you can explore the different directories and files within the repository and use them to learn and practice go programming.

## Algorithms

Golang Forge also includes a variety of algorithms, ranging from simple to complex. The `algorithms` directory contains a collection of algorithm implementations in go. These algorithms include sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.

## Data Structures

Data structures are an important part of programming, and Golang Forge covers a wide range of them. The `data-structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more.

## Snippets

The `snippets` directory contains a collection of useful go snippets that can be used as a reference or starting point for your own code.

## Playground

The `playground` directory is where I experiment with new go concepts and ideas. It contains a `play.go` file which is untracked in git so feel free to explore and experiment in this directory.

> To omit the changes to `play.go` run the following command

``` Bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged ./playground/play.go
```

## Applied Mathematics

the `applied-mathematics` folder contains go code that implements various mathematical concepts and equations. these files cover a range of topics, including linear algebra, calculus, probability, and more.
