- \<language> Forge does not have any additional requirements beyond \<language> itself.
- Any required third-party libraries or modules specified in the individual files

### Usage

You can use \<language> Forge by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legitShivam/<language>-forge.git
```

From there, you can explore the different directories and files within the repository and use them to learn and practice \<language> programming.

## Algorithms

\<language> Forge also includes a variety of algorithms, ranging from simple to complex. The `algorithms` directory contains a collection of algorithm implementations in \<language>. These algorithms include sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.

## Data Structures

Data structures are an important part of programming, and \<language> Forge covers a wide range of them. The `data-structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more.

## Snippets

The `snippets` directory contains a collection of useful \<language> snippets that can be used as a reference or starting point for your own code.

## Playground

The `playground` directory is where I experiment with new \<language> concepts and ideas. It contains a `play.<language>` file which is untracked in git so feel free to explore and experiment in this directory.

> To omit the changes to `play.<language>` run the following command

``` Bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged ./playground/play.<language>
```

## Applied Mathematics

the `applied-mathematics` folder contains \<language> code that implements various mathematical concepts and equations. these files cover a range of topics, including linear algebra, calculus, probability, and more.
